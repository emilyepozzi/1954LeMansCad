  <h2>Description.</h2>
  <div class="description-lemans">

    <p>The Cadillac Le Mans was a concept car designed by Harley Earl and developed by Cadillac. It was the name for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France, in which Cadillac competed in 1950. Displaced at the 1953 General Motors Motorama in New York City, the design was a low-profile (51 inch to the windshield frame), two-seater, fiberglass-bodied roadster. This concept showcased Cadillac`s first wrap-around windshield. It was powered by a 250 hp version of Cadillac`s 331 cu inch V8 engine, a power output not realized in the production of Cadillac`s until 1955. The overall length of the Le Mans was 196 in. </p>

    <p>Though four prototypes were built, the model never went into production. </p>

<p>Of the four Cadillac Le Mans cars, the fate of three is known. One car, which was customized by George Barris, was acquired by Harry Karl, a wealthy shoe manufacturer who gave it to his wife, Marie "The Body" MacDonald. Another was sold to a Cadillac dealer in Beverly Hills, CA. The George Barris custom was partially destroyed in a fire in 1985, while another one is currently displayed in the Cadillac Historical Collection in Warren, Michigan. The revised car with quad headlights is in possession of the GM Heritage Center.</p>

<p>The fourth Cadillac Le Mans was displayed at the Oil Progress Exhibition at Will Rogers Field in Oklahoma City in 1953, along with two other show cars from the 1953 Motorama exhibition. After that, this car went on exhibit at Greenhouse-Moore Cadillac Chevrolet in Oklahoma City during the first week of November. The vehicle went missing on November 8, 1953 and has not been seen since that time.</p>

    <h2>The Le Mans and I.</h2>
    <div class="about-lemans">


      <p>Years ago, I was an avid collector of Cadillacs and GM Products. At the time I had 238 Cadillacs and owned 3 of the GM Motorama buses.</p>

      <p>I love the GM concept cars but never had the big money to buy a completed or undamaged car.</p>

      <p>An automotive acquaintance of mine, Gene from Santa Paula California, called me and said he had found a very rare and desirable car, I had dealt with this man for years, he found cars that nobody could find! I wish I had kept a few of the cars that he came up with, he was the master of the rare automobiles. He knew the Southern California market and the different Car Niches.</p>

      <p>He told me he found what was left of one of the four 1954 Le Mans vehicles, this car had been owned by Harry Carl, the Mega shoe store entrepreneur, who we all knew it was modified by George Barris, as a gift to Harry Carlâ€™s love interest.</p>

      <p>I was a 1954 Eldo fan, but followed the Le Mans because of its rarity and great beauty, and the presence of another Le Mans at a Cadillac dealer in Southern California.</p>

      <p>I asked what was left of the car, Gene said he would bring it by in the next couple of days. I knew the car was partially damaged in a fire.</p>

      <p>When he delivered the parts that he had there were a few burnt parts, but most did not experience the fire. I made the purchase and acquired the parts.</p>

      <p>I own the parts that were on the sight, including the title.</p>

      <p>Wouldn't it be great if some gifted person could re-create this magnificent automotive sculpture??</p>

<p>I am now old, and neither have the time or money to do this car. I am selling most of my cars so I do not burden my family with my stuff. I would love this car go to someone who could bring it from the burnt phoenix or the rightful place that it has in automotive history.</p>

      <p>This car is Southern California, Harley Earl and George Barris. A movie star past.</p>

      <p>You can own it; you can recreate the splendor of automotive magnifico, in this third existing Le Mans.</p>

<p>Price $75,000</p>

<p>I will consider a trade. </p>

<p>Please call me if you have any questions. I would love to speak with you about this car.</p>
